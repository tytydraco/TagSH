# TagSH
Execute universal shell scripts with the tap of an NFC tag

# Why?
Originally I made this app for running benchmarking commands. It can be a hassle to open up a terminal emulator, navigate to your script directory, and then execute it. It's much easier to just tap my NFC tag and have it run everything for me. Plus, then I can install TagSH on my other phones and run the same benchmark.

# Features
- No internet permission (your data is stored locally)
- ZLIB compression of scripts
- Flash your scripts directly from the app
- AMOLED terminal theme
- App can be closed when you scan the tag
- Script is stored directly on the tag, so it's universal
- Can work without root (permissions are limited of course)
